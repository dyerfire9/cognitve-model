# This model simulates a simple typing skill acquisition task (pressing A, B, C)
# under two conditions: 
# 1) With prior explicit knowledge (pre-defined letter-to-key rules).
# 2) Without prior knowledge (implicit trial-and-error learning).
# The agent is based on the CLARION architecture, using pyClarion for implementation.
# We track the agent's accuracy over 300 trials and measure learning speed and errors.
